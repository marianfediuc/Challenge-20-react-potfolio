        <p>
        Hello, I'm Marian! I switched gears from my education in Material Science and System Design to take on Web Development to keep challenging myself in ways I thought I never could. 
        Web Development allows me to continually create and creatively find new ways to make processes better. I always believed that anything can be improved and 
        there are different ways to solve problems.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        With that being said, I am Full Stack Web Developer based in the Austin Texas Area with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and 12+ years professional experience in System Design. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things. I am a problem-solver who 
        questions everything. I am a hard worker who has an eye for detail and who enjoys the little things in life. You will always find a smile on my face, I am also problem solver with a optimistic personality.
        <br></br>
